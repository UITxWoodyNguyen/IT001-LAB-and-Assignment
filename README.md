## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Browse to the relevant folder for the lab or assignment you want to review.
2. Open `.cpp` files in your preferred C++ IDE or editor (e.g., VS Code).
3. Compile using a C++ compiler (see below).
## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the `.cpp` files found in these directories, you will need a C++ compiler such as:
* GCC/G++ (MinGW for Windows or native on Linux/macOS)
* Clang
* Visual Studio Code with the C/C++ extension
* Codeblocks

### Compilation

You can compile any of the source files using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
g++ -o solution your_file.cpp
./solution
```

Replace `your_file.cpp` with the file you want to compile.
